  <h1>Introduction</h1>  
  <p>I'm a Mexican girl named after the Ancient Greek goddess of the Moon: "Selene". I studied English Literature and love Art. I'm currently taking a Front-End Web Development course because Iwant to have the tools to give form to ideas that I've been putting off for ages!</p>
  <p class= "highlight-paragraph">What's most important for me is to be happy, taking chances and never regretting any decision I've taken.</p>

<h1>Where I'm from</h1>  
  <p>I'm from Mexico city: one of the most crowded cities in the world! Living in Mexico can be very exciting but I wanted some piece and quiet so I moved to Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
  <p class= "highlight-paragraph">I work in the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, where I'm in charge of the Communications and Marketing section of the Graduate School. </p>

<h1>More about me</h1> 
  <h2>What are your favourite hobbies?</h2>
  <p> I love reading curled up on a comfy chair or coach. It's better if it's in a room with a fire.</p> 
  <h2>What sort of music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p> I've recently been listening to John Fahey a lot. I'd never heard his music before and I find it very relaxing. Especially when I'm cooking dinner after a long day at work.</p>
